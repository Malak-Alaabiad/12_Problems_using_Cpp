# 12 Different Problems Using C++

I use tinyfiledialogs.h to make my code read any file from the pc

message and lookup files to test problem 10 

Test cases for problem 11:
file + file1 = identical ( word to word and character to character )

file + file 2 = identical ( word to word ) 
( output in case of char to char )
line: 1
File 1: 'W'
File 2: ' '

file + file3 = 
( output in case of word word )
Files differ at line 2
File 1: file.
File 2: File.
( output in case of char to char )
line: 2
File 1: 'f'
File 2: 'F'
